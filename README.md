# Mujaffas Handicar

This is a game I am making in my spare time, it is going to be on Mobile devices, probably only on Android as Iphone sucks and is waaaay to expensive to get a developer account and release apps on the store. (Plus I am not sure if I can just make it to Iphone, I don't know if the code needs to be different for Apple products).

<h3>Description</h3>
It is a endless "runner", runner in quotation marks, because you are not running, you are driving in a wheelchair. It is going to be a mix between the old web game "Mujaffas BMW" and "Subway Surfers"

It is a reference to South Park, where Timmy has made his own Ã¼ber app, where he drives around South Park with people as a taxi. 

So you are driving as Timmy in his wheelchair, pulling around a wagon. Right now there is only a road with three lanes and you can navigate in between these lanes, you can also go a little forward and backwards.

<h3>Future Features</h3>
In the future there is going to come cars and busses coming towards you in the different lanes, and you have to navigate in between them to not get hit. There should also be an obstacle where Kenny is running across the road.

I have not decided whether you are going to have health and just loose some every time you get hit, or if you die instantly on first hit. I am leaning mostly towards the health, because that will make more gameplay as you would be able to pick up health potions/repair kits.

It might be so you should be able to tab on the screen, and if you are close to pedestrian he should pick him/her up and drive some time with them, and if you don't die before the passenger gets off, you get some extra points.
