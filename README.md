# Mujaffas Handicar

This is a game I am making in my spare time, it is going to be on Mobile devices, probably only on Android as Iphone sucks and is waaaay to expensive to get a developer account and release apps on the store. (Plus I am not sure if I can just make it to Iphone, I don't know if the code needs to be different for Apple products).

<h3>Description</h3>
It is a endless "runner", runner in quotation marks, because you are not running, you are driving a wheelchair. It is going to be a mix between the old web game "Mujaffas BMW" and "Subway Surfers"
<br /><br />
It is a reference to South Park, from the episode where Timmy has made his own Ã¼ber app, where he drives around South Park with people as a taxi. 
<br /><br />
So you are driving as Timmy in his wheelchair, pulling around a wagon. Then cars are coming towards you that you have to avoid to not be damaged. You will be able to be hit around 3 times by cars before you run out of health. Besides cars, there are also another obstacle and that is Kenny running across the street. You do not wan't to run him over, as it also gives you a little damage, but it also takes away a larger amount of points.
<br />
I have also made tiers, so the longer you survive, the harder it will become. There are of course a max tier, so it does not become impossible, but it will become gradually more difficult.
<br />
To give more gameplay I have added Jimmy into the game as well, he walks on the sidewalk, and if you drive over to the side where he is walking and tab the screen, you will greet him and get some bonus points. If you tab the screen without Jimmy nearby, he will just yell out 1 of his 25 other phrases.
<br />
For more fun, I have added a couple pick up items. These include a repair, so you get some health back. A boost on the ground, this will make it so you drive twice as fast with rocket fire shooting out the back of the wheelchair and if you hit a car, you will not loose health, instead the car will blow up and give you the same amount of bonus points you would have lost if you were not boosting. And the last item I have added so far is a shield, if you pick this one up, a blue shield will surround you, and you cannot take damage from cars, they will not blow up, but they won't damage you.

<h3>Future Features</h3>
I have considered adding in so, if you tab on the screen and you are close to pedestrian, Timmy should pick him/her up and drive some time with them, and if you don't die before the passenger gets off, you get some extra points. If this becomes a reality, I have thought about making it so, if you hit a car with a passenger, the passenger will get out before time, and you some points should be retracted from your score.
